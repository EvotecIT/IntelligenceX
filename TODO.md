# IntelligenceX Onboarding Roadmap (Wizard + CLI)

Status: In progress

## Phase 0 — Goals & constraints
- [ ] Confirm onboarding goals (wizard + PR-only path + upgrade path)
- [ ] Confirm default auth choice (vendor OAuth for single repo, BYO App for org)
- [ ] Confirm secret handling policy (auto if Sodium, manual fallback)
- [ ] Confirm UI choice (local web UI + Spectre.Console wizard)

## Phase 1 — Core setup architecture (shared by CLI + UI)
- [x] Add SetupHost orchestration layer (single source of truth)
- [x] Add wizard state model (repos, config, auth, apply mode)
- [x] Implement Plan → Apply flow with dry-run output
- [x] Implement upgrade/modify detection (existing workflow/config)

## Phase 2 — CLI Wizard (Spectre.Console)
- [x] Add Spectre.Console dependency (CLI project only)
- [ ] Implement interactive steps:
  - [x] Auth mode selection
  - [x] GitHub auth flow
  - [x] Org vs repo selection
  - [x] Repo multi-select
  - [x] Config presets + advanced JSON editor
  - [x] OpenAI login (reuse if present)
  - [x] Apply (PR creation)
- [x] Non-interactive fallback (--plain, redirected input)
- [x] Summary table + PR links
- [x] Keep-secret propagation for cleanup

## Phase 3 — GitHub App Manifest (BYO App)
- [x] Manifest generation (pre-filled app definition)
- [x] Open GitHub "Create App from Manifest"
- [x] Handle callback and exchange code for app id + PEM
- [x] App install flow (select repos / all repos)
- [x] Store app credentials locally for reuse

## Phase 4 — Secrets handling
- [x] Auto-encrypt and upload secrets when Sodium available
- [x] Manual secret fallback (print export + instructions)
- [x] Support INTELLIGENCEX_AUTH_KEY for encrypted store

## Phase 5 — Local Web UI Wizard
- [x] Local web host (Kestrel) + static assets
- [ ] Wizard screens (same steps as CLI)
- [x] Advanced JSON editor panel
- [x] Progress checklist + success summary
- [x] "Manage existing setup" flow (load config from repo)
- [x] Workflow preview in web UI
- [x] Config presets (local storage)
- [x] Preset export/import (web UI)
- [x] Status badges (auth/repo/secret)
- [x] Enforce loopback + HTTP-only binding
- [x] Device flow timeout + expiry messaging
- [x] GitHub App manifest flow in web UI
- [x] Detect existing workflow/config (repo inspection)
- [x] Recommend setup actions based on inspection
- [x] Support auth bundle input for secrets (web UI)
- [x] Update-secret support in web UI

## Phase 6 — Reviewer improvements
- [x] Early auth validation with actionable errors
- [x] Safer auth store handling in reviewer
- [x] Explicit secrets in workflow (no secrets: inherit)

## Phase 7 — Docs & README
- [x] README rewrite (what it is, trust model, quickstart)
- [x] Docs: wizard onboarding, CLI quickstart, security/trust
- [x] Screenshot placeholders + asset folder

## Phase 8 — Copilot (experimental)
- [ ] Keep CLI Copilot optional provider
- [ ] Research native Copilot feasibility
- [x] Add provider toggle in wizard

## Phase 9 — DevEx automation
- [ ] Auto-resolve IntelligenceX bot review threads after fixes (CLI command or GitHub App action)
